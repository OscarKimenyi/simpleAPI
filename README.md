## Understanding Backup Schemes
A backup is a copy of data that is made to protect against data loss. It‚Äôs a way to make sure that if something goes wrong‚Äîlike a system crash, accidental deletion, hardware failure, or a cyberattack‚Äîyou can restore your important files, systems, or databases.
### The following are the common backup schemes.

#### 1. Full Backup.
A full backup involves the creation of a complete copy of an organization‚Äôs files, folders, SaaS data and hard drives. Essentially, all the data is backed up into a single version and moved to a storage device. It‚Äôs the perfect protection against data loss when you factor in recovery speed and simplicity. However, the time and expense required to copy all the data (all the time) may make it an undesirable option for many IT professionals.

#### Advantages
- Easy to restore since all data is in one backup.

- Provides complete protection at a single point in time.

#### Disadvantages
- Takes the most time to perform.

- Requires large storage space.

### 2. Incremental Backup
Incremental backup involves backing up all the files, folders, SaaS data and hard drives that have changed since the last backup activity. This could be the most recent full backup in the chain or the last incremental backup. Only the recent changes (increments) are backed up, consuming less storage space and resulting in a speedy backup. However, the recovery time is longer since more backup files will need to be accessed.

#### Advantages
- Saves time and storage by only backing up changed files.
  
- Efficient for frequent backups.

#### Disadvantages
- Slower recovery time since it needs the last full backup and all incrementals.

- More complex to manage.

### 3. Differential Backup
Differential backup falls between full backup and incremental backup. It involves backing up files, folders and hard drives that were created or changed since the last full backup (compared to just the changes since the last incremental backup). Only a small volume of data is backed up between the time interval of the last backup and the current one, consuming less storage space and requiring less time and investment.

#### Advantages
- Faster to restore than incremental backup (only need last full + differential).

- Easier to manage than incremental.

#### Disadvantages
- Takes more space than incremental backup.

- Grows larger each day until the next full backup.

##  bash_scripts Overview

This folder contains three Bash scripts used for monitoring, backing up, and updating the server hosting this API.

### 1. `health_check.sh`

- **Purpose**: Monitors the server‚Äôs health and verifies API functionality.
- **Checks performed**
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk usage
  - Status of Nginx web server
  - Availability of `/students` and `/subjects` endpoints using `curl`
- **Logs to**: `/var/log/server_health.log`
- **Warnings** are recorded if:
  - Nginx is inactive
  - API endpoints return non-200 status
  - Disk usage is ‚â• 90%
    

### 2. `backup_api.sh`

- **Purpose**: Creates a backup of:
  - The Node.js API project directory (`/var/www/my_node_api`)
  - If using a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), export the database to /home/ubuntu/backups/db_backup_$(date +%F).sql.
- **Backup location**: `/home/ubuntu/backups/`
- **Format**
  - API files: `api_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz`
  - Database: `mongo_backup_YYYY-MM-DD/`
- **Old backups (older than 7 days)** are deleted automatically.
- **Logs to**: `/var/log/backup.log`


### 3. `update_server.sh`

- **Purpose**
  - Updates Ubuntu packages
  - Pulls the latest code from GitHub
  - Restarts the Nginx web server
- **Logs to**: `/var/log/update.log`
- If `git pull` fails, the script logs the error and aborts without restarting the server.

##  Setup Instructions

1. **Upload the scripts to your EC2 instance**
   ```bash
   scp bash_scripts/*.sh ubuntu@<your-server-ip>:/home/ubuntu/
   ```
2. **Set executable permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/ubuntu/health_check.sh
   chmod +x /home/ubuntu/backup_api.sh
   chmod +x /home/ubuntu/update_server.sh
   ```
3. **Run scripts manually for testing**
    ```bash
    ./health_check.sh
   ./backup_api.sh
    ./update_server.sh
    
    ```
4. **Schedule scripts via cron**
   ```bash
    crontab -e

   ```
   Add the following lines
    ```bash
    # Health check every 6 hours
    0 */6 * * * /home/ubuntu/health_check.sh

# Simple API with Docker and MySQL

This project demonstrates how to containerize a simple Node.js API using Docker and Docker Compose. It exposes two endpoints:

- `/students`
- `/subjects`
  
NOTE: Always ensure XAMPP control panel is open and MySQL is started during your project lifespan
  
## üê≥ Docker Setup

### 1. Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t assig-api .
```
### 2. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name  old-assign-api old-assign-api
```
Then visit:

http://localhost:5000/students

http://localhost:5000/subjects

## ‚öôÔ∏è Docker Compose (API + MySQL)

### 1. Start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start a MySQL database container (db)

- Start the Node.js API container (api)

- Setup volumes for data persistence

### 2. Visit Endpoints
http://localhost:5000/students

http://localhost:5000/subjects

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment on AWS EC2

### 1. Launch an EC2 Ubuntu instance.

### 2. SSH into your instance:

```bash
ssh -i kim.pem ubuntu@13.61.178.87 
```

### 3. Install Docker and Docker Compose:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```
### 4. Clone this repo and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OscarKimenyi/simpleAPI.git
cd simpleAPI
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 5. Open security group ports:

- TCP 5000 (your app)

- TCP 3306 (if you want DB exposed‚Äîoptional)

## üêô Docker Hub

### 1. Create account to Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/)

### 2. Login to Docker Hub

### 3. Tag your Image

- You can tag your local image with your Docker Hub username.

```bash
docker tag assign-api oscar1210/assign-api
```

```bash
docker tag assign-api oscar1210/assign-api:latest
```

### 4. Push the image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push oscar1210/assign-api
```
- Or with version:

```bash
docker push oscar1210/assign-api:latest
```
### 5. To pull and run

```bash
docker pull oscar1210/assign-api
docker run -p 5000:5000 oscar1210/assign-api
```

This project demonstrates a scalable front-end and back-end architecture using Docker containers, an NGINX load balancer with round-robin algorithm, and deployment on AWS EC2.

---

## üì¶ Dockerized Setup Overview

- **Frontend**: React-based application (three containers)
- **Backend**: Flask API (one container)
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX (containerized, round-robin with health checks)
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7 (containerized)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OscarKimenyi/simpleAPI.git
cd simpleAPI
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and Run Front-End Containers

Step-by-step Instructions
### 1. Build the frontend image:

```bash
docker build -t oscar1210/assignment4-frontend ./frontend
```
### 2. Run three frontend containers:

```bash
docker run -d --name frontend1 oscar1210/assignment4-frontend
docker run -d --name frontend2 oscar1210/assignment4-frontend
docker run -d --name frontend3 oscar1210/assignment4-frontend
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer Configuration

NGINX as a Load Balancer
- Algorithm: Round-robin

- Health Checks: Configured using proxy_next_upstream directive to skip unhealthy instances

Sample NGINX Config (inside /nginx/nginx.conf):


Run Load Balancer

```bash
docker build -t oscar1210/assignment4-loadbalancer ./nginx
docker run -d --name loadbalancer -p 80:80 --link frontend1 --link frontend2 --link frontend3 oscar1210/assignment4-loadbalancer
```

### 2. Update and install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```
### 3. Clone your repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OscarKimenyi/simpleAPI.git
cd simpleAPI
```
### 4. Start all services with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d

Make sure port 80 and 5000 are open in your EC2 Security Group settings


## üß∞ Troubleshooting

Problem 1: Frontend not loading	                                                    
Solution: Ensure all frontend containers are running (docker ps)       

Problem 2: Load balancer gives gateway error	
Solution:  Make sure frontend containers are --linked or in same Docker network

Problem 3: MySQL port conflict	     
Solution: Stop other MySQL instances (sudo systemctl stop mysql) or remap port

Problem 4: Header not appearing	                                   
Solution: Check the NGINX config and container logs for frontend1, 2, 3

Problem 5: Port 80 already in use	                                 
Solution: Stop conflicting services (sudo lsof -i :80) and re-run load balancer

Problem 6: Accessing via browser fails	                             
Solution: Use public IPv4 of EC2, ensure port 80 is open in Security Group
